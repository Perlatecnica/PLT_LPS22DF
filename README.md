# PLT_LPS22DF

This is an mbedOS library for driving the LPS22DF pressure and temperature sensor

## Description

The LPS22DF is an ultracompact, piezoresistive, absolute pressure sensor designed to function as a digital output barometer. Compared to its predecessor, the LPS22DF boasts lower power consumption and achieves lower pressure noise.

This device consists of a sensing element and an IC interface, facilitating communication over I²C, MIPI I3CSM, or SPI interfaces between the sensing element and the application. Additionally, it supports a wide Vdd IO range for the digital interfaces. The sensing element, responsible for detecting absolute pressure, features a suspended membrane manufactured using a specialized process developed by ST.

The LPS22DF is housed in a full-mold, holed LGA package (HLGA), which ensures operation over a temperature range spanning from -40 °C to +85 °C. The holed package design enables external pressure to reach the sensing element.
